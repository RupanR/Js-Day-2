Variables
Operators
Datatypes
Alert,prompt,confirm


Javascript: 
 => Created by Netscape in 1995
 => Originally called LiveWire then LiveScript
 => Developed By Brandon Erich

Js is a synchronous single threaded programming language. 


Variables:- It is name given to memory location.
=>var 
=>let
=>const

syntax:-  keyword(var/let/const) variableName = value;
ex:- var a = 10 || let a=10 || const a =10

var :-
=> It is keyword to declare Variables.
=> It can be redeclared and reassigned.
Ex:-
var a = 10;
a=20; //reassign
var a = 30; //redeclare
console.log(a);

let:-
=> It is keyword to declare Variables.
=> It can be only reassigned.
let a =10;
a=30; //reassign
console.log(a);

const:-
=> It is keyword to declare Variables.
=> It cannot be redeclared and reassigned.
const c = 10;
console.log(c);

Operators:-
=>Airthmetic Operators: +,-,*,/,%
=>Assignment Operator: =
=>Conditional Operators: <,>,<=,>=,!=,!==,==,===
=>Logical Operators: & ,||

Loose Equality:- (==)
If the value is same it will return true
Example:
 3 == "3" true

Strict Equality:- (===)
Both Value and datatype should be same then only it will return true 
example: 
3===3   true
3==="3" false


Window methods/events:-
Alert:- 
alert("Click Ok to enter into the website")

Prompt:-
let result = prompt("Enter your Name")
console.log(result)

Confirm:-
let result1= confirm("Are you sure to enter the webiste")
console.log(result1);

Datatypes:- 
String,Number,Boolean,Array,Object,Bignint,Symbol,Null,Undefined

TypeOf:-
To identify the type of the particular variable we use typeof() method.
syntax: typeof(variableName)
example: 
var a = 10
console.log(typeof(a))

Undefined:- 
=> If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned,
then the value of that variable is undefined.
=> Then the datatype is also undefined.
Example:-
let a;
console.log(a);

Null:- 
=> Null is a special value that represents empty or unknown values
=> The type of null will be an object.
=> It is a known bug in Javascript.
=> Javascript defines that null is equal to undefined.
Example:-
let num = null;
console.log(num);
console.log(typeof(num));


Array :-
=>Collection of datatypes
=>It will be in sequence manner.
=>Enclosed within []
=>Index always starts with 0
=>To print the values inside the array we have use
arrayname[indexvalue]
=>To find the length dynamically we have to use
arrayname.length
=>To find the last index in an array we have to use
arrayname.length-1

Example:- 
var a =[1,2,3,"abc",true]


Object:- 
=>Object is a collection of properties
=>Object are structured with key value pair
=>Objects do not have index
syntax:-
var/let/const objectname ={
    keyname:value
} 
Example:-
let person = {
    firstname:"John",
    lastname:"Doe",
    age:35,
    gender:"Male",
    phonenumber:9876543210,
    skills:["Javascript","HTML","CSS","Reactjs"]
}
console.log(person);
